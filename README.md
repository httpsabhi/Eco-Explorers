# EcoExplorers
A Predictive Model for Animal Conservation Status Using Machine Learning by **TEAM-XO!**

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the conservation status of animal species based on their characteristics and habitat information. The goal is to create a tool that helps conservationists and policymakers make data-driven decisions to protect endangered species more efficiently.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution aims to develop (EcoExplorer) a predictive model for classifying the conservation status of animal species using a comprehensive machine learning approach. The key components of this solution include:
/n
**1. Integration of Temporal and Geospatial Data**
Temporal Analysis: Include time-series data to capture trends and changes in species populations over time.
Geospatial Analysis: Incorporate GIS data to include spatial variables such as habitat quality, environmental changes, and human activity impact.
/n
**2. Image Based detection**
Accurately identify and classify various species of wildlife based on image
/n
**3. User-Friendly Interface**
API Development: Create an API for easy integration with other tools and platforms, allowing users to input new data and obtain conservation status predictions.
Interactive Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly interface or dashboard to visualize predictions and underlying data insights, making it accessible to conservationists and policymakers.
